# FinalProject

This final project is a command-line game in which the player's goal is to get the briefcase in a room.
The room is dark, and ninjas are out to kill you.  You have one bullet to shoot a ninja, but that's it.
Also, you can look ahead up to two spaces to see if there are nearby ninjas.  You then take your turn after.
